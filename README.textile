h1. javierburon.net personal website

h2. To do soon

* -Projects should be more different from the other content. think about that- added "recommended" style to non personal content
* -Add type of data icons in each frame: proyecto, link, video, libro, pelicula, foto, presentacion, articulo-
* -text styles depending on the background color-
* -Link to my domain javierburon.net-
* Work on a more developed detail page:
** browsable background carrousel
** think on how to embed media content: video, issuu, presentation etc
* Add google analytics javascript
* Work on a transition between main page and detail page. fade maybe?
* Work on a navigation system in the detail page. back and forward. maybe left to right slide? 
* Reload dinamically http://css-tricks.com/dynamic-page-replacing-content/

h2. To do later

* General views for each type of data: I want to see all the links, all the projects, all the videos and so onâ€¦
* Think in multilingual issue: how to solve it? Write in english and spanish indistinctly
* Add more past content:
** Write descriptions for uploaded material
** GIS talk and presentation
** Laboratorio nuevas profesiones presentation
