The exhibition itself was designed and built by Magdalena Sánchez and myself and commissioned by Fundación Caja de Arquitectos, Spain.

This technique is often called visual scribing in which a spoken track describes ideas and concepts while the graphics are being drawn. I finally didn't add the audio track as the video was supposed to be played in noisy environments. Music track is called 'Pearl' and it is composed by "Jahzzar":http://betterwithmusic.com/.

The video is shot using my trusty four megapixels camera "Canon Powershot S45":http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canons45/ I bought it while I was doing my final thesis and it still working great. It has a fantastic feature that you can't find anymore in consumer cameras, you can hook it directly to the computer and control it remotely.

The software has an interval shooting option so you can automatically shoot a picture every five seconds (that's a hardware limitation due the USB 1.0 connection) while you keep drawing without interruption.
